# Bikesharing
Tableau

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create several visualizations to determine the statistics for Citi bike trip rides from NYC to assess the viability of a bike ride share business in Des Moines, Iowa. Jupyter Notebook was used to edit the original CSV to convert some of the data types, and Tableau was used to visualize the data. We created analyses for the following categories: Bike Checkout Times by User and by Gender, 3 heat maps fore trips by gender, trips by weekday, and trips by gender and weekday. We also utilized analysis of gender breakdown in a pie chart and a heat map for bike repairs represented by a heat map.
