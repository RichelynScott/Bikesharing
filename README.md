### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create several visualizations to determine the statistics for Citi bike trip rides from NYC to assess the viability of a bike ride share business in Des Moines, Iowa. Jupyter Notebook was used to edit the original CSV to convert some of the data types, and Tableau was used to visualize the data. We created analyses for the following categories: Bike Checkout Times by User and by Gender, 3 heat maps fore trips by gender, trips by weekday, and trips by gender and weekday. We also utilized analysis of gender breakdown in a pie chart and a heat map for bike repairs represented by a heat map.

### Results

CHECKOUT TIMES FOR USERS:

The vast majority of Citi Bike users only used the bike for about 8 minutes with the vast majority (85+%) using it less than 40 minutes

CHECKOUT TIMES BY GENDER:

Same analysis but with Gender taken into account: note the trend is the same but utilization of this service is more men than women

TRIPS BY WEEKDAY & HOUR:

Use during weekdays shows 6-9AM & 4-7PM as highest use. Use on weekends tended to be more 10AM-8PM use W/ increased Night use

TRIPS BY GENDER, WEEKDAY, & HOUR:

Same analysis but with Gender taken into account: note the trend remained the same but we see the use again is skewed heavier for men vs women or unknown again

TRIPS BY GENDER, WEEKDAY, & USER TYPE:

This Heat map Shows us the vast majority of users are subscribers are men and the highest number of customer use is UNK gender--most likely individuals who did not want to fill out the field with accurate information

GENDER USE PIE CHART:

As alluded to in a few earlier story points this pie chart exemplifies the user base of the Citi Bikes and demonstrates that about 75% of the user base are Men and about 20% are women

STARTING LOCATIONS HEATMAP:

This heat map shows us the areas where most users start/pickup a bike to use are on the southern tip of the peninsula with areas around it being high use, highest use to the SW area of the peninsula

### Summary
Citi Bike has provided us with a lot of useful data that we were able to visualize through the use of Tableau to prove that a similar start-up in Des Mois, Iowa would be a feasible endeavor if it is determined that demand would also be there. For this project to work however, 2 additional visualizations that would help for future analysis would be one of bike utilization so we could determine which bikes would need service soonest or most often and a visualization displaying average trip distance/length to again help with bike servicing and utilization data.
